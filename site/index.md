[OnDataEngineering]({{ site.url }}) is a site focused on how to make the right data available in the right form in the right place at the right time to allow users to efficiently exploit it.  This covers a range of use cases (including the acquisition and staging of data, "big data" preparation and data warehousing) to support any type of exploitation (be it reporting, big data analytics, machine learning or any one of a dozen similar capabilities).

This site currently hosts a catalog of technologies that fit within this space, organised [alphabetically](/technologies/), [by category](/tech-categories/) and [by vendor](/tech-vendors/).  We also have a [blog](/blog/) that covers updates to the site as well as industry news, and a set of [forums]({{ site.discourse_url }}) .

In the future it is planned for this site to also look at key use cases for different technologies within the Data Engineering space along with a set of independent, technical and critical evaluations of various technologies and architectural patterns against these. Please see the [introduction](/blog/2016/12/12/the-plan/) blog post for further details.
